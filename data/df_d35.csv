A fact-based response to anyone who claims Biden has accomplished nothing…,"Feel free to use this response. I’m open to critiques as well. I find that the loudest people claiming Biden has accomplished nothing, or has governed from the center-right, are young leftists, who (imho) are most likely to cost us the election by voting for a third party candidate or refusing to vote at all. 

*Response below:*

Biden’s record includes:

- $1.2 Trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill
- CHIPS Act
- ⁠$891 Billion Inflation Reduction Act

These bills alone are going to fundamentally transform the U.S. economy over the next decade, including a projected 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We’re finally updating our nation’s crumbling infrastructure after decades of presidents promising and failing to do so. We’re even rebuilding our industrial manufacturing base.

Biden is undoubtedly the most progressive, productive, and effective Democrat since LBJ. And he accomplished all of this with razor thin Congressional majorities and an opposition party that wants to destroy the federal government. No other 2020 candidate could have accomplished Biden’s historic record. Sometimes age, wisdom, and experience pay off.",democrats,1702427720.0,t3_18h2sf9

"I was doing a deep dive personal study on the Kent State protest shooting in 1970, and it really gave me a wake up call on how the GOP has been heavily demonizing Young Americans and college students for over 50 years plus, way before the advent of social media and the current “culture war”.","It really made me realize the 60’s and 70’s wasn’t all “counterculture” and that even the majority of American people at the time even blamed the students and still to this day. 

Just crazy to see how long the GOP has actively been demonizing younger people and college students who are more diverse and seek more education, especially with how out in the open it was before social media and Fox News etc.

 Another thing put into perspective for me with this issue not being something that became intensified or exclusive during my generation as a younger millennial being demonized by the GOP, but the fact it’s been so ongoing for decades and has been very out in the open. Recently read a few comments of student tour guides today on the Kent state campus who hear snarky and disgusting remarks from parents of the students who say the protestors shouldn’t have instigated the situation, or ”should have just followed the rules and it wouldn’t happen”.",democrats,1701033554.0,t3_184l69j

"If there’s one thing that’s going to boost young voter turnout for the party in 2024, it’s this","People are fed up with the GOP’s stance on abortion. I know some are panicking about Trump potentially winning and that’s understandable, but if he doubles down on banning abortion like the other GOP candidates have, it’s going to hurt him at the ballot box big time. In 2019 when his policies began to kick in, he promised to ban late term abortion and the next year he ended up losing in most of the states he carried in 2016. 

A couple weeks ago, we saw in Virginia and Ohio that if abortion is on the ballot, it’s more than likely going to tip the scales in favor of the Democrats. Some of the swing states that Biden won in 2020 like AZ, PA, and NV have put it on the ballot, so with increased voter turnout from young people like we saw in Ohio and Virginia, it’s very likely that he carries those states again. 

Again, this doesn’t mean we should get comfortable, but there’s nothing wrong with being optimistic. The most important thing you can do is get out and vote.",democrats,1700629403.0,t3_1811cxz
“What These Swing Voters Have To Say About The 2024 Election” — a maddening listen,"YIKES. This was a really frustrating listen. It’s hard to sit there and listen to people completely mischaracterize Trump, Biden, and the platforms of their parties, and act as if they are informed about anything they are talking about.

It is annoying to listen to people who clearly are NOT informed about politics try to justify their feelings. The people interviewed had NO idea who else is running in the Republican primary— and yet their opinions on “why Biden isn’t a good president” are supposed to hold weight? Yeah right.

The woman couldn’t even explain what she meant. The amount of “I don’t knows…. You know” or “I just want someone who is a good president” and then using that sentence to segue to why she is voting for Trump…? Absolutely delusional.

The first guy forgot who else he liked in the Republican primary (DeSantis), and when he remembered, said “I like how he is running Florida” — well, awesome. Can you provide any context of what you mean, or any specifics about what you like about HOW he is running Florida?

It is absolutely maddening to listen to this woman say “I want a president who wants what is best for our country” and then go on some uninformed rant about why that person is Trump and how Biden isn’t doing anything.

Clearly, these voters lack any sense of nuance or basic political common sense. What a frustrating listen to give such a platform to ineptitude. The smartest person interviewed in this podcast was the little boy at the end.",democrats,1700625818.0,t3_1810ck8

College student in need of a Democrat’s perspective for an assignment!,"
Hey all,

If this post isn’t allowed I’ll take it somewhere else. I’m in college, taking an honors political science course that focuses specifically on the right side of the political spectrum and its foundations / futures, then the lefts, then how the two interact, as well as polarization as a whole. One of my major assignments is to interview someone on the right, and someone on the left. While I interviewed my dad for the right, none of my relatives are liberal / democrat, and I live in the middle of nowhere so that’s also not helping. All it’ll be is just me asking a couple questions, and you providing your input. (More details the better). You must *explicitly* politically identify as one of the following: democrat / liberal / left leaning, otherwise it won’t count for the assignment. If anyone is able to, I’d be eternally grateful. Its currently 11:20 pm on 11/18 and I’m about to head to bed, this assignment is due at 11:59 on the 19th so the sooner I get a response the better. I hope to see someone soon!",democrats,1700371387.0,t3_17ypud9
